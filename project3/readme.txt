2. Python 3.8.1 was used for this. Due to me using the normal dict as
    an ordered dict you MUST use atleast python 3.7.0 for this to work.
3. The code is structured as such:
    The main file is check_true_false.py which reads inputs from files
    and calls functions in logical_expression.py() which is where the real
    work for this project is done.
4. python check_true_false.py wumpus_rules.txt kb2.txt statement.txt
    Is an example of the code I personally used to verify all functions
    are working correctly.
    It works exactly as specified in the assignment so you shouldn't have
    any troubles with it as long as you're in python3.
